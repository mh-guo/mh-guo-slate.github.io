I am interested in both theoretical and observational astrophysics. I have done several research with Prof. 
I'm currently an undergraduate from Peking University under the supervision of Prof. Luis C. Ho and Kohei Inayoshi.

<h1> Hunting for Wandering Black Hole </h1>

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wandering_BH.png "Profile Picture"){:.profile}

We investigated low-density accretion flows onto massive black holes orbiting around in the outskirts of their host galaxies (e.g., massive ellipticals, Milky Way, dwarf galaxies), performing three-dimensional simulations and semi-analytical calculations. We constructed radiative inefficient accretion-flow models for accretion near the horizon of a black hole. I applied the simulation results to the emission model and calculated the spectral energy distribution for the accretion flow onto a wandering black hole. I studied the detectability of wandering (super-massive) black holes in different types of galaxies, predicting that ALMA will enable us to hunt for a population of wandering BHs. I published a paper in the Astrophysical Journal as the first-author.
